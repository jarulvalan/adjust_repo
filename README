1).

As per my understanding of the requirement, I have written a python code which prints random numbers from 1 to 10.

Command to Run : python cli_rand.py

It will go to the new CLI like below and enter the command ==> "rand"

random-cli>rand

OutPut : 

Random Number from [1-10] :  10
Random Number from [1-10] :  4
Random Number from [1-10] :  5
Random Number from [1-10] :  5
Random Number from [1-10] :  1
Random Number from [1-10] :  8

2).

During SSL offloading cpu load will increase - we can check using following commands (uptime, top, top, iostat, dstat)
Then we can check the log files, if we use webserver and load balacer.
Check  the 5xx Error to know the metrics of failed and success rates for incoming packets.

If we use any Queue (rabbitmq or etc) server to handle the request to process the data then check the logs for failed queues.

Note : If my understanding of the requirement is wrong please let me know I would eager to work the challanging tasks.
